# SHIOL+ v2.0: AI-Powered Lottery Analysis System

An intelligent system designed to analyze historical data and predict lottery combinations using Machine Learning techniques.

## Project Summary

**SHIOL+ (Heuristic and Inferential Optimized Lottery System)** is a software tool that analyzes historical Powerball lottery draw data to identify statistical patterns. The system's main objective is to use an artificial intelligence model to predict the probability of each number appearing in future draws, thereby generating optimized plays.

Unlike traditional random number generators, SHIOL+ makes data-driven decisions, learning from thousands of past draws to identify trends, frequencies, and other subtle features that can influence results.

> **Important**: This tool was created for educational, research, and entertainment purposes. The lottery is a game of chance, and SHIOL+ **does not guarantee prizes or winnings**. Always play responsibly.

## Key Features

SHIOL+ v2.0 focuses on a clean and efficient pipeline with three key functionalities accessible from the command line:

*   **`train`**: Trains the Machine Learning model (an `XGBoost` classifier) using the complete historical dataset. The model learns to associate statistical and temporal features of the draws with the winning numbers. The trained model is saved in the `models/` directory.
*   **`predict`**: Loads the already trained model to predict the probabilities for each number (white balls and Powerball) for the next draw. Based on these probabilities, it generates a specified number of unique, weighted plays.
*   **`backtest`**: Performs a historical simulation to evaluate the performance of the model's strategy. It generates a set of plays and compares them against all past draws to calculate performance metrics like total cost, winnings, and Return on Investment (ROI).

The system's artificial intelligence works by creating a statistical profile for each draw, including data like parity, sum of numbers, and recency. The AI model learns to "score" number combinations based on how well they align with the profiles of historical winning draws.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modular directories to facilitate maintenance and scalability.

-   `src/`: Contains all the application's source code.
    -   `cli.py`: The command-line interface (CLI) entry point that orchestrates all operations.
    -   `loader.py`: Loads, cleans, and standardizes historical lottery data.
    -   `intelligent_generator.py`: Includes the feature engineering logic (`FeatureEngineer`) and the weighted play generator (`IntelligentGenerator`).
    -   `predictor.py`: Manages the training, evaluation, and loading of the AI model, as well as generating predictions.
    -   `evaluator.py`: Contains the logic to run the `backtest` and calculate historical performance.
-   `config/`: Configuration files. `config.ini` centralizes all system parameters.
-   `data/`: Stores raw data, such as the `NCELPowerball.csv` file with historical results.
-   `models/`: Saves the trained AI model artifacts (`shiolplus.pkl`).
-   `outputs/`: Default directory for any files generated by the system (currently not actively used, but available).
-   `logs/`: Stores application execution logs for debugging and tracking.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.10+
-   Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install all dependencies, it is recommended to first create a virtual environment and then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## System Usage (CLI)

All interactions with SHIOL+ are done through `src/cli.py`.

1.  **Train the model**:
    *   This command must be run first to create the AI model.
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py train
    ```

2.  **Generate predictions (plays)**:
    *   Uses the trained model to generate a specific number of plays. The `--count` parameter is optional (defaults to 5).
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py predict --count 10
    ```

3.  **Backtest the strategy**:
    *   Simulates the strategy's performance by generating plays and testing them against the history.
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py backtest --count 20
    ```

## Configuration

The `config/config.ini` file allows for adjusting the system's behavior without modifying the code.

-   **`[paths]`**: Defines the paths to data, model, and log files.
-   **`[model_params]`**: Hyperparameters for the model, such as `test_size` for the test data split.
-   **`[temporal_analysis]`**: Parameters for temporal feature engineering, like the `time_decay_function`.
-   **`[cli_defaults]`**: Default values for CLI arguments, such as `count`.

## Training and Evaluation

Training is performed with the `train` command, which processes historical data and generates a `shiolplus.pkl` model file.

Evaluation is done with `backtest`, which provides a JSON report with the following key indicators:
-   **`total_cost`**: Total simulated cost of having played the generated combinations.
-   **`total_winnings`**: Total simulated winnings.
-   **`roi_percent`**: The Return on Investment, showing the strategy's profitability.
-   **`win_distribution`**: A breakdown of the number and type of prizes that would have been won.
